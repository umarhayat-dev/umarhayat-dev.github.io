🧠 Hello World
Umar Hayat
Python Developer | AI Systems Architect | Workflow Automation Specialist

I design and deploy AI-powered systems that streamline operations, eliminate bottlenecks, and scale with your team — whether you're a lean startup or an enterprise managing millions of data points.

🔍 About
I’m a self-taught AI systems engineer with a background in multi-modal data training and enterprise automation. Over the past two years, I’ve led the design, deployment, and optimization of AI-integrated workflows — leveraging LLMs, vector databases, RESTful APIs, and event-driven architectures.

I began in the world of LLM training, fine-tuning large-scale models using structured data pipelines across text, audio, and video modalities. From there, I transitioned into building production-ready automation systems that integrate tools like OpenAI, LangChain, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL — far beyond low-code platforms.

My work is focused on creating intelligent, resilient systems that reduce cognitive load, automate repetitive logic, and allow teams to operate at scale.

💼 Experience
AI Data Trainer – TaskUs (Remote)
2022 – 2024

Fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs by curating high-quality prompt data pipelines.

Evaluated model responses across key metrics (factuality, safety, latency) to improve deployment performance.

Collaborated cross-functionally to iterate training workflows and enhance feedback loops.

Tech Support & Automation – Al-Yusr Institute
2021 – 2022

Built lightweight automation pipelines to reduce manual overhead in scheduling and client onboarding.

Migrated workflows to cloud-based tools (e.g., Make.com + Gmail API) and implemented basic RPA patterns for repetitive tasks.

🚀 Projects
📁 Portfolio Website
A fully custom-built developer portfolio using React + TailwindCSS with API-connected project updates and smooth SPA routing. Optimized for performance and SEO.

📚 Al-Yusr Institute Platform
A production-grade React + Firebase stack web platform with real-time auth, user dashboards, dynamic course tiles, and full admin control panel built from scratch.

⏰ Break Reminder Daemon
A cross-platform Python script using tkinter and apscheduler that runs as a background service, issuing non-intrusive reminders for screen breaks.

✉️ Email-to-Sheets Tracker
A Gmail API + Google Sheets integration that syncs and parses relevant email threads into structured spreadsheet records using Python and OAuth2.

🔄 Custom Workflow Automations
Developed modular automations using Python, FastAPI, and OpenAI to streamline sales workflows, auto-tag leads, generate reports, and sync data across CRMs and cloud services — designed for scalability beyond Make/Zapier limitations.

🌌 Future Plans – AI Operating System
A command-layer for life:
Imagine saying,

“Summarize today’s emails, update client invoice #42, fetch recent performance logs, and send me a status summary.”

And it just happens.

This isn’t a chatbot. This is a real-time AI agent stack — combining memory, context, execution, and UI abstraction into one personal operating system.
That’s what I’m building next.
